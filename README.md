# Towards uncertainty aware treatment assignments inprecision oncology. 
# An evolving contextual banditproblem

This is the implementation of treatment assignment with *[Deep Bayesian Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09127)* paper, published in [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) 2018. 

## Contextual Banddit

## Data


## Usage: Basic Example

This library requires [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), Numpy, Pandas, and [Deep Bayesian Bandits](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deep_contextual_bandits).

The file *treatment_assignment.py* provides a complete example on how to use the
library. We run the code:

```
    python treatment_assignment.py
```
